% [centroids, intersectionIndex, dimensionIndex] = insertCentroids(nIntersections, dimensions, nClusters, nOutliers, compactness)
%
% Description: This function puts the centroids of the clusters into 
%              solution space
%
% Inputs:
%   nIntersections: the number of intersections per dimension
%   dimensions:     the number of dimensions
%   nClusters:      the number of clusters
%   nOutliers:      the number of outliers
%   compactness:    compactness coefficient for the clusters
%   
%
% Outputs:
%   centroids:          array with the centroid coordinates
%   intersectionIndex:  array of indices of intersections to locate
%                       clustes/outliers
%   dimensionIndex:     index of main dimensions (other dimensions are 
%                       assigned randomly)
