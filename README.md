# mdcgen-matlab
Generator of synthetic n-dimensional datasets for clustering (MATLAB version)

# Files:
example.m  ------------------> Quick parameterization example
example_vb.m ----------------> Verbose parameterization example (since docu is pending, this works as kinda tutorial)
mdcgen.m --------------------> MDCGen tool, "[r] = mdcgen (p)"
extra_tools/dist_gen.m ------> Generator of empirical distributions
extra_tools/Gvalidity.m -----> Gvalidity indices for cluster overlap evaluation

"nearestSPD" is required to implement feature correlations.
