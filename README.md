# mdcgen-matlab
Generator of synthetic n-dimensional datasets for clustering (MATLAB version)

## Files:
*_example.m_, quick parameterization example.
*_example_vb.m_, verbose parameterization example (since docu is pending, this works as kinda tutorial).
*_mdcgen.m_, MDCGen tool, "[r] = mdcgen (p)".
*_extra_tools/dist_gen.m_, Generator of empirical distributions.
*_extra_tools/Gvalidity.m_, Gvalidity indices for cluster overlap evaluation.


"nearestSPD" is required to implement feature correlations.
