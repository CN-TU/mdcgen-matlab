% function [distribution] = setDistribution(distributionIn, dimensions, nClusters)
%
% Description: 
%   The function sets the distribution depending on the configuration.
%
% Inputs:
%   distributionIn: distribution to be set. As a scalar it is a uniform
%                   distribution for every cluster and every dimension.
%                   As a vector it specifies a distribution per cluster.
%                   As a matrix it specifies a distribution per cluster and
%                   per dimension.
%   dimensions: number of dimensions for the dataset
%   nClusters: Number of clusters
%
% Outputs:
%   distribution: The correctly set distribution
